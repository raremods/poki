# Release channels

Poki's iPhone builds are published as GitHub Releases on this repository. Qeno Setup (the desktop
installer) reads them and lets each person pick a channel in Settings. A channel decides which
releases Qeno Setup installs and renews with.

| Channel | Tags | GitHub release | Who it is for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stable | `ios-vX.Y.Z` | full release | everyone |
| Beta | `ios-vX.Y.Z` | prerelease | testers (the default while every `ios-v*` release is a prerelease) |
| Alpha | `ios-alpha-X.Y.Z-N` | prerelease | early testers: builds picked by a maintainer, rough edges expected |
| Pre-alpha | `ios-prealpha-X.Y.Z-N` | prerelease | developers who want every snapshot |

A channel includes the channels above it: Beta installs the newest Stable or Beta release, Alpha
the newest Stable, Beta or Alpha, and Pre-alpha the newest release of any kind. Qeno Setup's own
updates (`desktop-v*`, `desktop-alpha-*` and `desktop-prealpha-*` tags) follow the same channel.

## Cutting a release

- Stable or Beta: push `ios-vX.Y.Z` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). It is published as a
  prerelease (Beta); to promote it to Stable, untick "Set as a pre-release" on the release page.
- Alpha or Pre-alpha: run `native/ios-app/scripts/cut-release.sh alpha` or `... pre-alpha` (defaults
  to the head of `poki/ios-integration`; pass another ref as the second argument). It tags the commit
  `ios-alpha-<VERSION>-<commit count>` or `ios-prealpha-<VERSION>-<commit count>` and pushes the tag;
  `.github/workflows/channel-release.yml` builds the app and puts it into the channel's one rolling
  prerelease, `ios-alpha-latest` or `ios-prealpha-latest` (replacing the previous build's files, title
  and notes, so the Releases page never fills up with test builds), with the same files as a Beta: `Poki-external-*.ipa`, `Poki-*.ipa`, `Qeno-signing.zip`, `poki-relay-worker.js` (the relay Worker Qeno Setup deploys) and `SHA256SUMS`. The build
  number is the commit count, so a later commit always has a bigger one. The versioned tag stays as
  the record of each build; Qeno Setup reads the version from the IPA's name. Qeno Setup's own
  installers (`PokiSetup-<version>-<build>-macos.dmg` / `-windows-x64-setup.exe` with
  `SHA256SUMS-desktop.txt`) are added to the same rolling release and replaced the same way. Only a
  Stable release is ever marked Latest. The same commit can be both a
  pre-alpha and, once it looks good, an alpha. `DRY_RUN=1` prints the tag without pushing it.

Both workflows run only on their tags, never on branch pushes. The Mac server's update notice
(`src/update-check.mjs`) reads `releases/latest`, which never returns a prerelease, so neither Beta
nor Alpha nor Pre-alpha releases reach it.
