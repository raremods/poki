/// OpenAI. It plays one talk's worth of the Realtime API's events into VoiceModel, the way the unit
/// tests' FakeConnection does, so every state of the talk's screens can be seen without a key, a
/// microphone or sound: Qeno listens, hears a request, thinks, runs a step on the phone (a stand-in
/// that only waits), speaks, is spoken over, and answers again. VoiceModel handles the events as it
/// would OpenAI's: its phases, lines and the end after a quiet while are the real ones. Nothing is
/// sent anywhere and no step runs on the phone.
///
/// `-pokiTalkRehearsal lost` drops the connection at the end, for the talk's error state.
/// `-pokiTalkHold <state>` stops the script where the talk first reaches that state (`TalkState.named`),
/// for a screenshot of it.
