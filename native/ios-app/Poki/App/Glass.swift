import SwiftUI

// Liquid Glass for Qeno's own controls (ESP-340, the owner's "buttons and components support Liquid
// Glass"). On iOS 26 and later these are Apple's own effect, written from the SDK's declarations
// (SwiftUICore: `glassEffect(_:in:)`, `Glass`, `GlassEffectContainer`, `GlassEffectTransition`;
// SwiftUI: `GlassButtonStyle`, `GlassProminentButtonStyle`) and from Apple's "Applying Liquid Glass to
// custom views" and the Human Interface Guidelines' "Materials" (developer.apple.com, read
// 2026-11-11). Before iOS 26 they fall back to the system's materials with a hairline; the app still
// runs on iOS 18. The fallback has only been compiled and, with `-pokiGlass off`, looked at on an
// iOS 27 simulator: no older simulator is on the build machine.
//
// What this file keeps to, and where each rule comes from:
// - Glass is the layer of controls and navigation that floats over content. Human Interface
//   Guidelines: "Don't use Liquid Glass in the content layer." So the round buttons of the top bar,
//   the message field and a card that asks for an answer are glass; bubbles, the task card and the
//   settings cards are not. The suggestion pills are glass too; a drawn look-alike that samples
//   nothing (`PillLook`) waits for the owner's choice.
// - "Use Liquid Glass effects sparingly" (the same page): the few controls that matter most.
// - No glass on glass: the owner's instruction, and WWDC25 session 219 as the research note for
//   ESP-376 quotes it ("always avoid glass on glass"; I have not read the transcript myself). A
//   control inside a glass surface (the buttons in the message field, the status inside a pill) is a
//   plain fill or a tint.
// - Glass shapes near each other share one `GlassEffectContainer` ("Applying Liquid Glass to custom
//   views"): one sampling pass, and they can blend and morph.
// - `glassEffect` goes after the modifiers that change how the view looks (the same article).
// - The regular variant, not clear: clear is for photos and video behind it (Human Interface Guidelines).
// - The system's own bars, sheets and menus already are glass; nothing here touches them.
// - Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast are the system's to honour: it redraws its glass
//   itself, and the fallback's materials follow them too.
