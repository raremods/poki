/// the message field, under a quarter of the screen high, still unless Qeno is at work. Over it, on the
/// home page, lies the home's light: paper white above, blue rising from the bottom edge, breathing
/// slowly (ESP-470). In light, your first message makes the home's light sink 260 points and fade, so
/// it seems to draw back to the glow and stop there. In dark it stays where it is, stops breathing and
/// dims to a little under half: under the dark ground's plain top three quarters the conversation read
