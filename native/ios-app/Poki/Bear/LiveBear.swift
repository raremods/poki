// The three-dimensional bear, drawn live by RealityKit. The renderer's setup (RealityRenderer, the
// camera, light only from the model's own picture at exponent 0, no other light, no tone mapping,
// four-times multisampling, the paused animations scrubbed by time) is the modelling's own check
// renderer, rkrender.swift, with which the bear's colours were matched to the design. Any other light
// greys it.

/// The model's three files in Bear/Model, as the modelling hands them over. A new version of the bear
/// is these three files replaced; nothing in the code names a frame or a size of its own.
/// - PokiBear.usdz: the bear, with one timeline that holds every gesture;
/// - PokiBear-clips.json: where on that timeline each gesture is, in frames;
/// - PokiBear-light.png: the light it was coloured under.
